Excellent — this is the perfect point to clarify your **roadmap after migration**.
You are now moving from **Database + Backend Schema** → into **Frontend + UI + Features**.

Here’s the professional development flow you should follow:

---

# 📌 ✅ POST MIGRATION ROADMAP

## STEP 1️⃣ — Scaffold Backend CRUD (For Admin / Management)

**Reason:**
This is the easiest and fastest way to generate all Views + Controllers → so that your Admin can already view, create, edit, delete from a simple UI.

✅ Scaffold CRUD for `Users` → (Admin → Manage Users, Ban/Suspend, Delete...)
✅ Scaffold CRUD for `Rides` → (Drivers → Manage posted rides)
✅ Scaffold CRUD for `Bookings` → (View/manage bookings)
✅ Scaffold CRUD for `Reviews`, `Stores`, `RidePoints`, `PointClaims`, `SupportTickets`, `Invites`

**✅ This will generate:**

* Controller (UsersController.cs)
* Views (Index, Create, Edit, Details, Delete)

---

## STEP 2️⃣ — Scaffold/Enable Identity → Register/Login/Forgot Password (FOR NORMAL USERS)

**Reason:**
CRUD is for backend/admin.
For user-facing "Sign Up" / "Login" / "Forgot Password" → you need to enable **ASP.NET Core Identity UI**.

✅ Register → Sign up page
✅ Login → Login page
✅ Forgot Password → Forgot Password page
✅ Email Confirmation → (Optional but recommended)

✅ This comes with prebuilt Razor Pages — you can customize the look later.

---

## STEP 3️⃣ — Customize Views → Match User Stories

**Reason:**
The scaffolded pages are ugly and basic.
Now you apply the "UI / UX" work based on your user stories.

✅ Example: Users CRUD → Add filters, buttons, status (Active/Suspended) indicators.
✅ Example: Rides CRUD → Better datepickers, Google Places autocomplete, seat limit validations
✅ Example: Bookings → Show booked trips only for logged in user
✅ Example: Reviews → Show rating stars

You can style this via Razor Views + Bootstrap + Partial Views.

---

## STEP 4️⃣ — Build User Dashboard and Website Flow

**Reason:**
User must see their profile, rides, bookings, history → after login.

✅ After login → Redirect to Dashboard
✅ Dashboard → Quick Links: My Profile / My Rides / My Bookings / Invite Friends
✅ Allow user to edit profile (Profile Management User Story)

---

## STEP 5️⃣ — Test + Polish + Add Optional Features (Points, Claims, Support Tickets)

Once core flow works:

✅ Ride → Book → Review → Done
✅ Then add → Points system, Invite friends, Support Ticket, Point Claims

---

## OPTIONAL (later): Add API or Blazor + AJAX for dynamic parts

✅ Ex: Real-time seat availability → AJAX (no refresh)
✅ Ex: Invite Email sending → Backend email service
✅ Ex: Admin Dashboard with live stats → API + Charts

| 1        | Users (CRUD)                                  | Scaffold Controller + Views            |
| 2        | Identity (Register/Login)                     | Scaffold Identity / Enable / Customize |
| 3        | Rides (CRUD)                                  | Scaffold Controller + Views            |
| 4        | Bookings (CRUD)                               | Scaffold Controller + Views            |
| 5        | Reviews (CRUD)                                | Scaffold Controller + Views            |
| 6        | Dashboard / My Account                        | Custom Razor Pages + Views             |
| 7        | Points / Invites / Stores                     | Scaffold / Custom Views                |
| 8        | Admin Panels (Manage Users / Rides / Reviews) | Scaffold or Custom Pages               |

✅ You are **NOW READY** to begin Step 1 → Scaffold Users (Backend CRUD)
✅ Then → Step 2 → Scaffold Identity (Register/Login/Forgot Password)
✅ Then → Step 3 → Customize and make it nice and follow User Stories
