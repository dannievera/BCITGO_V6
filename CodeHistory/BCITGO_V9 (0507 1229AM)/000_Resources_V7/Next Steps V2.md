If you want, I can generate also:

ðŸ“‚ **FULL FOLDER STRUCTURE (exact Pages/ folders + cshtml expected files)** â†’ so you just need to copy-paste folders and start.
ðŸ“‘ **Razor Pages TEMPLATE (boilerplate file â†’ form + validation + sample list)** â†’ so you can just copy easily for each.

Just say:

> Yes, please make my full folder structure + Razor Pages template now.

And I will continue right away ðŸ‘‡
