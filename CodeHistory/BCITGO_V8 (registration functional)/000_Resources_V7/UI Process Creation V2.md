Perfect â€” this is *exactly* what a properly prepared project looks like after migration and scaffolding.
Hereâ€™s your **current project status** (âœ… means DONE):

| Part                          | Status                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database and Migrations       | âœ… DONE (migrated, working, tables present in SQLite)           |
| Models                        | âœ… DONE                                                         |
| DbContext + DbInitializer     | âœ… DONE                                                         |

# ðŸ“Œ ðŸš¦WHATâ€™S NEXT â€” YOU ARE HERE ðŸš¦

## âœ… STEP 1 (NOW): Build Basic UI and Views

Right now â†’ your Scaffold CRUD only generated **basic table + Create/Edit/Delete views.**

So next you need to:
ðŸ‘‰ (1) Improve/Add Design (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap)
ðŸ‘‰ (2) Connect navigation (Navbar, Home, Dashboard, etc)

**Tasks to do now:**

âœ… Go to **Views â†’ Shared â†’ \_Layout.cshtml** â†’ Add navigation links (Home, Users, Rides, Bookings...)

Example:

```html
<nav>
    <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a> |
    <a asp-controller="Users" asp-action="Index">Users</a> |
    <a asp-controller="Rides" asp-action="Index">Rides</a> |
    <a asp-controller="Bookings" asp-action="Index">Bookings</a> |
    <a asp-controller="Stores" asp-action="Index">Stores</a>
</nav>
```

âœ… Customize each Index.cshtml page in Views (already auto-generated) â†’ to make sure table displays cleanly

âœ… Add Create/Edit/Delete â†’ test UI flow â†’ Create Users, Rides etc.

---

## âœ… STEP 2 (Optional but highly recommended now): Add Identity for Sign Up / Login

Your CRUD UsersController is **for admin only** (backend CRUD).

But for real **USER REGISTER + LOGIN** â†’ You need:

* Register
* Login
* Logout
* Forgot Password
* Manage Account

âœ… To add this â†’ **Scaffold Identity â†’ Add Identity â†’ Select Register, Login, Logout, Manage**

This will add:

```
Areas â†’ Identity â†’ Pages â†’ Account
    - Login.cshtml
    - Register.cshtml
    - Logout.cshtml
    - Manage (folder)
```

This will allow **public users to register and login** â†’ very important next step now.

âœ… Users â†’ Register
âœ… Users â†’ Login
âœ… Users â†’ Logout
âœ… Users â†’ Manage account (optional)

---

## âœ… STEP 3 (Next after Identity) â†’ Connect Logged-in User to the Ride and Booking flow

After you are done with CRUD and Sign Up/Login:

ðŸ‘‰ Users can login
ðŸ‘‰ They should be able to see:

* My Profile â†’ Edit (User edit their profile)
* Search Rides â†’ Book Ride (Booking page)
* My Bookings â†’ View/Cancel

You will create **user-friendly pages** (Razor Pages or Controller + Views) for:

âœ… My Profile
âœ… Find Rides (Search + List Rides)
âœ… Book Ride â†’ Booking
âœ… My Bookings â†’ Show all bookings
âœ… Support â†’ Submit Support Ticket (optional)

| âœ… Next Now â†’ (Priority 1) | Add Identity â†’ Register/Login/logout pages                                   |
| âœ… Next â†’ (Priority 2)     | Add HomeController and Home Views (Landing Page, About, How it works, etc.)  |
| âœ… Next â†’ (Priority 3)     | Customize CRUD Views (Index, Edit, Create) to improve layout                 |
| âœ… Later (Optional)        | Add Razor Pages for User Pages â†’ My Dashboard, My Bookings, My Profile, etc. |
| âœ… Later (Bonus)           | Add Bootstrap or CSS for better design                                       |

# âœ… Final recommendation (what to do right now after this)

### ðŸ“Œ Immediately do this now:

1. Add â†’ Scaffold Identity â†’ Select Register/Login/Logout
2. Add links to \_Layout.cshtml â†’ make navigation simple
3. Customize Views for Users, Rides, Bookings (Index.cshtml, Create.cshtml) â†’ nicer forms/tables
4. Test full CRUD flow â†’ Create, Edit, Delete Rides, Bookings etc.
5. Test User Register/Login â†’ with Identity scaffolded pages

---

If you want â†’ I can also make your "STARTER TEMPLATE" now:

âœ… \_Layout.cshtml (Navbar and Menu)
âœ… HomeController â†’ Home / About Pages
âœ… Users / Rides / Bookings Views sample design

So you can just copy/paste and instantly make your website ready-to-use.

---

If ready â†’ just say:

ðŸ‘‰ **"Yes, prepare my Website Starter Template now."**

I will immediately generate your starter templates for the UI side + controllers â†’ for next step of your website ðŸš€
